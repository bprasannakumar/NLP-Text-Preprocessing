# Text-Preprocessing
Text preprocessing is the initial step of any NLP related program. After text is preprocessed, then the output can be fed into the next NLP pipeline for further semantic analysis.
This repo contains files related to text preprocessing such as tokenization, stemming and lemmatization, and removing stop words and punctuations.
